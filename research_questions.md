# Brainstorm document about research questions

* How to purify text?
	- What does 'pure' mean?
	- When is text pure enough?
* How to ensure the promises of (text) digitization are realized?

## Evaluation study

* What is the contributed value of using a lexical assessment database on top of ticclat?
	- Calculate performance of ticcl without using the lexical assessment database
		- On what corpus?
	- Create benchmark corpora for the lexical assessment database
		- With different distributions of relevant and irrelevant data
	- Calculate performance of ticcl with lexical assessment database (containing different datasets)
